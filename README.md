# analogue-image-media
This repository holds ontologies and data about analogue image media. More specifically and for the time being this is about the 135mm films that were produced from the 1930ies up to present.

This project originates from my PhD thesis from 2015 which provides a dating aid for analogue 135mm still image films. 

This project and its ontology is closely related to the Knora application that is being developed by the Digital Humanities Lab of the University of Basel. You will find it at https://github.com/dhlab-basel.
